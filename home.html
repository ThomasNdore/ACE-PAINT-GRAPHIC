                    <h3 class="faq-question">Question: What is the difference between ceramic coating and paint protection film?</h3>
                    <p class="faq-answer">Answer: Ceramic coating is a liquid polymer that chemically bonds with the vehicle's factory paint, providing a protective layer that enhances gloss and repels dirt and water. On the other hand, paint protection film (PPF) is a transparent film that offers physical protection against scratches, rock chips, and environmental damage. Both solutions provide different types of protection and can be combined for maximum safeguarding.
